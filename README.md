# Hash Set (C++ Implementation)

This project is a custom implementation of a **Hash Set** in C++.  
A Hash Set is a data structure that stores unique elements and provides fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations using hashing.

## Features
- Stores unique integer values
- Supports insertion, deletion, and search operations
- Handles collisions with chaining / open addressing (depending on your implementation)
- Dynamic resizing when load factor exceeds threshold
- Demonstrates fundamental **data structures & algorithms** concepts
